# Shoes creation by using Generative Adversarial Nets
**Author: [Hoang Le](https://github.com/hminle) - [Hoang Nguyen](https://github.com/hoangnguyen3892)**

This repository developed a Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) to design and generate new shoes images. Many improvement techniques were implemented to enhance the performance of the model as well as the quality of the output.

This is also used as a final project for the course __Deep Learning for Visual Recognition__ Spring 2017 semester.
